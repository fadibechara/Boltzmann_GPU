# Boltzmann_GPU
MS HPC-AI Lattice Boltzmann GPU implementation

The goal of this project is using the GPU to parallelise the Lattice-Boltzmann algorithm modelling a fluid flow which encounters a cylinder in a 2D Plane.

The python GPU framework used will be numba.

A speedup benchmark report will be created to measure the benifits we obtained from using the GPU in this proposed situation.
